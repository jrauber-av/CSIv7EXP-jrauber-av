# CSI Experimental (Exp) Builds

The CSI Exp (beta) builds provide early access to new features, improvements, and fixes that are not yet available in the main release. These builds are intended for advanced users and testers who want to try the latest developments and provide feedback before official release.

Please note that Exp builds may include experimental or unfinished features, and there may be occasional bugs or instability. As a result, there's a small chance that changes, features, or enhancements may be dropped.

**See the Wiki tab for changes in the latest Exp build.**

If you encounter issues or have suggestions, please report them on the GitHub Issues page.

**General advice:**  
These are experimental builds! If you're not looking for surprises:

- Backup your current CSI .dll, .dylib, or .zip file before updating.
- Use a Reaper Portable Install or other non-critical test environment to try it out.
